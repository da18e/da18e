- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m DeAnna Allen-Trass
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in understanding this technological world we live in, which is why I chose Introduction to Information Technology.
- ðŸŒ± I enrolled in the University of Missouri in August of 1990. I have been working and raising my family for the last 30 years.  You're never to old to learn something new, so here I am, ready to finish.
